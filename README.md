# Contrastive-learning-project
Using Contrastive Learning to pretrain a Neural Network model for hand-writen image classification based on MNIST dataaset. Requirements:
1. Constructing CNN architecture based on Keras.
2. Defining a customized DataGenerator to yield the image samples and labels for each minibatchÂ 
3. Defining the Contrastive Loss (e.g., InfoNCE, NT-Xent and so on)
4. Using TSNE or Umap to visualize the latent space feature distribution
5. Training MLP layers based on the pretrained CNN model for hand-writen image classification and returning the accuracy from the MNIST testing set.
